# 📌 Professional Summary {#professional-summary}

## A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step

![My PC from **2007**](/images/my-pc.webp)  

With this PC, I took my first steps building sites with **Adobe Flash and PHP**, a combo long gone, but one that set me on **the developer path** I plan to walk for **as long as I can**.

This is where this path has brought me so far. For **more details**, check the [🔬 Project Case Studies](#project-case-studies).

# 🎯 Career Objective {#career-objective}
I'm seeking a role in an environment that **embraces transparency and communication**, where **clear processes** and **collaboration** can bring out **the best** in **my professional values and skills**.  
My goal is to **join or help a team become high-performing**, deliver an **unforgettable** developer and **user experience**, and **improve the quality of life** for both the **team** and the **end users**.

# ⚖️ Professional Values {#professional-values}  
Through my previous roles, I've learned **values that go beyond the code**, values that **support the team** from concept to release. These are the values I bring to every team I join.

## 🤝 Transparency and communication  
This is my **top priority.** I make sure the **team knows when** a task will be done, **how we plan** to develop it, and **why we approach** it that way.  

**If we can't deliver** on time, the next step is to **discuss openly what can be done** within the time we have.  
**Delaying bad news**, keeping a task **"almost done"** for weeks, or **omitting the release date** are just **ways of avoiding accountability**. That is why we **commit to transparency**, because **when we share** issues early, **we gain** room to react and **adapt together**.  

## ⏳ Process  
**Every development team has a process**, even if it is **'Go Horse'**, it is still a process.  
We seek to **understand** how the **process works**, **document it** clearly, and **improve it** step by step.  
This is the core of **Agile practice**: building **predictability** and achieving **sustainable delivery over time**.  

## 🤩 User impact first  
**Frontend** codebases **"die"** on average **in 5 years** through rewrites, framework shifts, or redesigns.  
**Backend** codebases last on average **10 years** before major replacement or replatforming.  

But a **lost user** is **lost forever**.  

**New features**, analytics, redesigns, and refactorings **mean nothing** if the **user is gone**.  
That is why we **prioritize user impact** above all, making sure every decision serves **what is best** for the **final user**.  

## 🏠 Ownership mindset  
I **treat the software** as if I am the **owner.**  
That means **caring** about quality, stability, and **user experience**, **not** just moving **tasks to "done."**  

After years of dealing with **bad code**, I feel responsible for **long-term maintainability** and for always **leaving the codebase better than I found it**.  

## 🍎 Healthy code  
**If you don't take time** to maintain the code, **the code will take the time** for you.  

Maintenance is **always** required.  

**To save** maintenance **costs**, I write **clean**, structured **code** from the **start**.  
**When** that is **not possible**, I **refactor bad patterns**, improve readability, and **simplify structures**.  
Sometimes a codebase needs **significant maintenance**, and the **only safe way** is for the **team** to acknowledge it and **schedule time** for it.  

## 🏰 Resilient code  
**Healthy** code is **not always resilient.**  
A codebase can be **clean and organized**, yet still **collapse at runtime** under **unexpected cases or heavy load**.  

A **mindful developer considers** the code, the hardware, the environment, the data flow, and **system behavior under pressure**.  

That is why I **code** for the **worst case**: catching exceptions, validating input data, **creating fallbacks** instead of assuming the happy path, and **logging external processes**.  

# 🖼️ Personal Interests {#personal-interests}  

My interest in high quality code goes beyond work and deep into my personal interests. But I also have others, here is a list:

- **Blogging:** [This is an old blog from 2013, now archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20130302224351/http://jonathanribas.com/). I made several blogs over the years and plan to consolidate all of them here soon.
- **Photography:** A personal hobby I keep improving over time.  
- **Music:** I'm no musician, but I try to play some instruments. My favorite genres are hard rock and 2000s techno.  
- **Game modding:** I love writing code for game mods and recently started publishing them. Here’s my collection for Project Zomboid [check it out](https://github.com/ribas89/project-zomboid-ribs-mods).
- **Nature:** The only reasons I ever leave home are to buy groceries, or stay in parks and campgrounds. I feel at peace being in nature, listening to the symphony of bugs and birds.  

# 🔬 Project Case Studies {#project-case-studies}  
My career objective has been shaped by every project I've worked on.  
Here is how I contributed to each of them, presented using the **STAR** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) approach.
