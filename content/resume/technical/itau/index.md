# ðŸŒŸ STAR Cases  
### STAR Case â€“ No compliance with WCAG Standards
### Situation  
With more than **90 million** users and about **24%** of the population living with **some form of disability**, a significant number of customers **faced barriers** using the app. The company had begun **enforcing WCAG** accessibility standards across **all digital products**.

### Task  
As part of a **cross-squad design system** team, I was responsible for **ensuring** the new Angular 7 **components complied with WCAG 2AA** accessibility standards. The team was tasked to:  
1. **Integrate accessibility requirements** into the design system's development workflow.  
2. **Validate accessibility with real users**, supported by a dedicated QA subteam composed of people with disabilities.  
3. **Guide external consultancy** to accelerate implementation and ensure technical alignment with accessibility best practices.

### Action  
The effort began by **contracting and onboarding a 7-person consultancy team**, integrating them into our workflow and **setting up their environments** to match the internal CI process. With the **team established**, collaboration expanded to the **QA group of testers with disabilities**, whose feedback guided accessibility refinements in **real use cases**. As the work evolved, our squad became the **bridge between design and engineering**, revisiting UI patterns and adjusting layouts, color palettes, and interaction models **to meet WCAG 2AA standards**. The **development phase** introduced **ARIA roles**, **keyboard navigation**, and **color-contrast adjustments**, ensuring full **compatibility with NVDA**, **VoiceOver**, and **TalkBack**. This transformed accessibility from a patch into a **core design system feature**. To close the cycle, the new practices were **documented and distributed** so future squads could maintain the same accessibility standards.  

### Results  
1. **Achieved WCAG 2AA compliance**: all components were validated through **real-user testing** with **NVDA**, **VoiceOver**, and **TalkBack**.  
2. **Enabled inclusive access**: more than **90 million users with** gained full accessibility across the company digital products.  
3. **Standardized accessibility by design**: accessibility rules became **part of the design system architecture**, not a post-release addition.  
4. **Ensured long-term scalability**: documented practices and reusable patterns **preserved accessibility compliance** in all future products.  
5. **Unified multidisciplinary collaboration**: design, engineering, QA, and consultancy teams **worked under a shared accessibility effort**.
