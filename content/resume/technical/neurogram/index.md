# ðŸŒŸ STAR Cases  
## STAR Case - Fragmented codebase  
### Situation  
The **previous codebase** combined Rails, React, Tailwind, GraphQL, and Docker across **multiple repositories** with **duplicated components** and **scattered configs**. This fragmentation caused **long onboarding** times, inconsistent standards, and clear signs of **vendor lock-in**.

### Task
**Considering** the in-house team's **low seniority** and the **complexity** of the **project**, I set out to **reshape the project's stack**, replacing **dependency hell** with an architecture that was **simple**, maintainable, and sustainable, pursuing the **following objectives**:  

1. **Standardize tooling** into a single, reliable workflow.  
2. **Accelerate onboarding** so developers could focus on building instead of setup.  
3. **Align stack with team skills** rather than forcing over-engineered solutions.  
4. **Prevent future rewrites** by choosing technologies compatible with the existing backend.  

### Actions
My **first step** was to **assess** what could be **salvaged** from the frontend. After **several attempts**, I confirmed that **refactoring** would be **slower than starting fresh**. Between **Next.js** and **Vite**, the latter was chosen for its **faster builds**, **simpler configuration**, and better **alignment with the backend stack** based on **Firebase** and **Google Cloud Platform**.  

Instead of leaving **developers** to **wrestle with** separate **Babel**, **PostCSS**, **Tailwind**, and **Docker** setups, I **collapsed dependencies** into one consistent **Vite configuration**. This **dramatically improved setup time** and enabled features like **obfuscation** and **vendor chunking** by default.  

Below is the build configuration file I introduced:  
```ts
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import tsconfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";
import obfuscatorPlugin from "vite-plugin-javascript-obfuscator";

type buildConfigOptions = {
  manualChunks?: boolean;
  vendors?: string[];
};

export const buildConfig =
  ({ vendors, manualChunks }: buildConfigOptions = {}) =>
  ({ mode, command }) => {
    const isProdBuild = ...;
    const noMinify = ...;
    const minify = ...;

    const vendorPath = [
      "jsencrypt",
      "i18n",
      "yup",
      "lodash",
      "dayjs",
      ...
      "lib-framework/src/fonts",
      "lib-framework/src/icons",
      "lib-framework/src/assets",
      "lib-framework/src/hooks",
      "lib-framework/src/tokens",
      "lib-framework/src/components",
      ...(vendors || []),
    ];

    const config = {
      define: {
        "process.env": {},
      },
      plugins: [
        react(),
        tsconfigPaths(),
        obfuscatorPlugin({
          apply: () => isProdBuild,
          ...
        }),
      ],
      build: {
        minify,
        rollupOptions: {
          treeshake: true,
          output: {
            manualChunks(id: any) {
              if (!manualChunks) {
                ...
              }

              for (const vendor of vendorPath) {
                ...;
              }

              return ...;
            },
          },
        },
      },
      ...

    return config;
  };
```

### Results
1. **Build security improved**: JavaScript obfuscation protected intellectual property and reduced reverse-engineering risks.  
2. **Bundle performance optimized**: **vendor chunking** and **tree-shaking** in the Vite configuration reduced payload size and improved runtime efficiency.  
3. **Maintenance costs lowered**: **collapsing** scattered **configs** into a **single pipeline** simplified upkeep and **reduced time wasted** troubleshooting environment inconsistencies.  
4. **New projects bootstrapped quickly**: standardized Vite setup enabled starting **fresh projects in minutes** with all necessary configurations **ready to use**.  
5. **Onboarding accelerated**: environment setup time dropped from **5 days to 5 minutes**, making it straightforward for developers of **any seniority** level to start **coding immediately**.  
6. **Team focus regained**: developers shifted attention **back to delivering features** instead of **resolving** fragmented build and config **issues**.  


## STAR Case - Unreliable Deployments  
### Situation  
The deployment pipeline was entirely **controlled by the consultancy**, including the **production and staging environments**. Deployments were **triggered automatically** with every change, **but the maturity** of the software and the team **was not ready** for such automation. As a result, **bugs were** introduced directly **into production**, **breaking the user experience** and creating unnecessary **troubleshooting overhead** for the team.  

### Task  
Shift the **ownership** of the pipeline and environments **back to the company**, simplify the deployment, and give **full control** to the **in-house team**. The objective was to design a **fast, easy, and manual deployment flow** that would only run when a developer explicitly triggered it, **reducing accidental** breakages in **production**.  

### Actions  
I **redesigned** the deployment **process** using the **minimum** resources and complexity **possible**. Since the company was part of the **Google for Startups** program, the infrastructure of choice was **Firebase**. To make deployments **simple and predictable**, I created a **GitHub Actions workflow** that consolidated all frontend projects **one codebase**. This ensured the process was manual, quick, and transparent, while **eliminating** the **hidden consultancy-owned** pipelines.  

Below is the GitHub Action I authored to handle all frontend projects in one place:  
```yaml
name: manual deploy

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      project-name:
        type: choice
        ...
      build-type:
        type: choice
        ...
env:
  ...

run-name: ${{ inputs.build-type }} TO ${{ inputs.project-name }} AT ${{ github.event.repository.pushed_at }} WITH ${{ github.sha }}
jobs:
  deploy_firebase:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ${{ github.workspace }}/proj-${{inputs.project-name}}/

    steps:
      ...
      - name: Deploy
        run: |
          curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
          firebase deploy --only hosting:target-${{inputs.project-name}} --token ... --project=project-${{inputs.project-name}}-DEV --config="../lib-framework/firebase.json"
```

### Results  
1. **Auditable and predictable deployments**: GitHub Actions provided **structured logs** and **version traceability**, ensuring every release could be **tracked** and verified.  
2. **Full control of environments**: **staging** and **production ownership** returned to the in-house team, preventing external bottlenecks and **restoring confidence** in releases.  
3. **Independence from external vendors**: embedding the deployment pipeline internally removed reliance on **opaque consultancy infrastructure** and secured long-term ownership.  
4. **Production incidents virtually eliminated**: replacing **consultancy-controlled auto-deploys** with **manual GitHub Actions workflows** reduced the risk of pushing unstable code directly into production.  
5. **Simplified release governance**: a **single reusable workflow** handled all frontend projects, reducing coordination overhead and increasing **team-wide transparency**.  
6. **Streamlined deployment process**: releases became a **two-click manual action**, intentionally designed to be **easy and reliable for any seniority level** on the team.  


## STAR Case - Code duplication  
### Situation  
**Multiple projects** implemented the **same logic** for API calls, encryption, i18n, and UI components. This led to **frequent code duplication**, inconsistencies between projects, and bugs caused by drift in how core features were handled.  

### Task  
**Eliminate duplicated logic** by creating a **single framework** that standardized core features and could be **reused across all projects**. The goal was to ensure consistency, reduce maintenance overhead, and accelerate new project setups.  

### Actions  
I authored a centralized internal library-framework that included:  
1. A custom **axios layer** with interceptors and typed adapters.  
2. A unified **crypto module** using a hybrid combination of **RSA** and **AES**.  
3. **Mock Service Worker** patterns and mock data for consistent testing and development.  
4. Preconfigured **project templates and setup files** to enable fast project creation.
5. Providers for **Firebase, context, i18n, overlay, and query handling**.  
6. Reusable **UI components** and design tokens.

### Results  
1. **Bug rates reduced**: redundant and inconsistent **duplicate logic** was **eliminated**, **reducing** maintenance **issues**.  
2. **Core features by default**: i18n, crypto, HTTP, and mocks were **included** by default in **every project**.  
3. **New projects scaffolded in minutes**: a complete baseline setup was **instantly available** for new development.  
4. **Single source of truth**: centralized frontend architecture **improved maintainability** and **increased team productivity**.
